# Road Accidents Data Analysis 🚗💥📊

This project explores a comprehensive dataset of road accidents to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights. The analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of accident causes, speed, and impact factors, which can inform road safety measures and policies.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **`Dataset/`**: Contains the road accidents dataset used for analysis.
- **`Reducing_Traffic_Mortality.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for detailed exploratory data analysis and visualization.  
- **`traffic_analysis_app.py`**: Streamlit application for interactive exploration of the data and results.  
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## 📊 Objectives

1. **Analyze accident frequency and severity across regions.**  
2. **Identify key factors contributing to accidents (e.g., Speed, Alcohol, First Ride).**  
3. **Visualize trends in accident data using interactive plots.**  
4. **Provide an interactive Streamlit app for end-users to explore accident data and insights.**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit,Seaborn
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards and static plots  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis  
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive app  

## 📌 Key Insights

- *Accidents peak during rush hours, indicating the need for better traffic management during these times.*  
- *Rainy weather significantly increases accident risk, emphasizing the importance of improved road conditions and driver awareness in adverse weather.*

## 💻 How to Run the Project

### Run the Jupyter Notebook

1. Open the `Reducing_Traffic_Mortality.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.  
2. Execute the cells to explore the analysis and visualizations.
